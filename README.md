# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali Sales Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a core aspect of data science, crucial for understanding data, identifying patterns, anomalies, and deriving actionable insights. This repository demonstrates EDA techniques and methods using Python, applied to the Diwali Sales dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is an excellent starting point for performing EDA and exploring the dynamic field of data science.

## Project Description

In this repository, the following tasks were performed:

- **Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation:** Prepared the dataset by addressing inconsistencies and ensuring it was ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Employed Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to explore and visualize the data.
- **Customer Experience Enhancement:** Identified potential customers based on different states, occupations, genders, and age groups.
- **Sales Optimization:** Analyzed product categories and specific products to help with inventory planning and forecasting demand.

## Key Findings

- **Target Demographics:** Married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, are more likely to purchase products.
- **Product Preferences:** Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most popular product categories among the identified demographic.

## Installation and Usage
